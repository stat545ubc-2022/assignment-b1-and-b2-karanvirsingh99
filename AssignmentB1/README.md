# Assignment B1 - STAT545B

This repository contains my submission for Assignment B1 for STAT545B. This assignment asks us to define a custom function, provide examples and tests for the function. My custom function can be found in the Assignment_B1.md file (which can be opened directly on github). The corresponding R Markdown file (.Rmd) can be downloaded and opened in RStudio.
